# TESTR - Troubleshooting Guide

## Stripe Integration Issues

### Problem: "Failed to create payment intent" in Production

**Symptoms:**
- Local development works fine with live Stripe keys
- Production deployment returns 500 error: "An error occurred with our connection to Stripe. Request was retried X times"
- Stripe account shows successful API requests locally but fails in Vercel

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Environment Variables**: Production environment variables may not be properly loaded
2. **API Version**: Different Stripe API versions have different compatibility 
3. **Network Issues**: Vercel servers may have connectivity issues to Stripe API
4. **Account Restrictions**: Live Stripe account may have API restrictions

**Debugging Steps Taken:**

1. **Verified Stripe Account Status:**
   - Stripe Shell command: `stripe payment_intents create --amount=100 --currency=usd`
   - Result: "Read-only access in live mode" (normal - confirms account is active)
   - Stripe dashboard shows 17 successful API requests, 0 failed

2. **Environment Variable Management:**
   ```bash
   # Remove and re-add clean environment variables
   vercel env rm STRIPE_SECRET_KEY production
   vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY production
   
   # Re-add with clean values
   echo "sk_live_..." | vercel env add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY production
   echo "pk_live_..." | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY production
   ```

3. **API Version Testing:**
   - Tried: `2024-12-18.acacia` (latest) - Failed
   - Tried: `2024-06-20` (stable) - Failed  
   - Tried: `2023-10-16` (older stable) - Testing

4. **Stripe Configuration Testing:**
   ```javascript
   const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, {
     apiVersion: '2023-10-16',
     timeout: 20000,
     maxNetworkRetries: 0, // Disable retries for debugging
   });
   ```

5. **Test Endpoint Created:**
   - `/api/test-stripe` - Isolates Stripe connectivity from payment logic
   - First test: Simple account retrieval instead of payment creation
   - Includes detailed error logging and environment variable validation

**Current Status:**
- Issue persists with Stripe connectivity from Vercel to Stripe API
- Local environment works perfectly with same keys
- Account verified as active and capable

**Latest Investigation (Aug 29, 2025):**
- **Key Finding**: Stripe dashboard shows successful payment intent creation with 200 status
- **Request Details**: POST /v1/payment_intents from IP 172.116.48.86 (Vercel) using API version 2024-06-20
- **Discrepancy**: Dashboard shows success but API endpoints return connection errors
- **Configuration Issue**: Test endpoint was using API version 2023-10-16, updated to match working version 2024-06-20
- **Status**: Still investigating intermittent connectivity vs successful dashboard logs

**Next Steps to Try:**
1. **Timing Issue**: The successful dashboard entries may be from earlier tests - monitor real-time
2. **Webhook Requirements**: Check if Stripe account requires webhook endpoints for live API usage  
3. **Account Verification**: Verify all business verification steps completed in Stripe dashboard
4. **IP Restrictions**: Check if Stripe account has IP restrictions blocking Vercel servers
5. **Alternative Test**: Try creating customers or other Stripe resources instead of payment intents
6. **Contact Stripe Support**: May be account-specific restriction

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/create-payment-intent/route.ts` - Added error logging
- `src/app/api/test-stripe/route.ts` - Created comprehensive test endpoint, updated API version
- Environment variables updated in Vercel (Aug 29: re-verified and cleaned)

**Key Learnings:**
- Always test Stripe integration with isolated test endpoints
- Environment variable issues are common in production deployments
- Stripe API versions can cause compatibility issues
- Network connectivity can differ between local and cloud environments

## SMS Integration

**Status:** ✅ Working  
- TextBelt integration functional
- SMS notifications sending successfully
- Occasional delivery delays (hours) due to carrier routing - normal for TextBelt

## Domain Configuration

**Status:** ✅ Complete
- Primary: `testr.j2j.info`
- Aliases: `testride.j2j.info`, `tester.j2j.info` 
- DNS configured in Squarespace (Google Domains migrated)
- SSL certificates auto-generated by Vercel

## Multi-tenant Architecture

**Status:** ✅ Complete
- Middleware handles `/shop/{slug}` and `/admin/{slug}` routing
- Original functionality preserved at root paths
- Ready for scaling to multiple bike shops
- Database schema prepared for multi-tenant support

## Production Deployment

**Live URL:** https://testr.j2j.info  
**Status:** Functional except Stripe payments

**Working Features:**
- Customer onboarding flow
- ID photo capture  
- Digital waiver signing
- SMS notifications
- Admin dashboard
- Multi-tenant routing

**Blocked Feature:**
- Stripe payment authorization (production environment issue)
