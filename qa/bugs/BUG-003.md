# BUG-003: Payment Step Client-Side Exception

## Summary
The payment step in the test ride flow throws a client-side exception, preventing users from completing the payment authorization process.

## Severity
**HIGH** - Blocks core payment functionality and test ride completion

## Description
When users reach the payment step (step 4) in the test ride signup flow, the application throws a client-side exception. The error message indicates "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading localhost" but the browser console is not accessible to view detailed error information.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the application with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate through the test ride signup flow
3. Complete steps 1-3 (Contact, Bike Selection, Verification)
4. Reach step 4 (Payment)
5. Observe client-side exception error

## Expected Behavior
- Payment step should render without errors
- Stripe payment elements should display correctly
- Users should be able to complete payment authorization
- No client-side exceptions should occur

## Actual Behavior
- Payment step fails to load
- Client-side exception error is displayed
- User cannot proceed with payment
- Test ride signup flow is blocked

## Technical Details
**Error Type:** Client-side exception during component rendering
**Location:** Payment step component (`src/components/PaymentStep.tsx`)
**Context:** Stripe integration with Apple Pay/Google Pay
**Browser Console:** Not accessible due to right-click restrictions

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be related to:
1. **Stripe Integration**: Complex Stripe Elements and payment logic
2. **Component State**: State management issues during payment setup
3. **Dependencies**: Potential conflicts between Stripe packages and React
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Type mismatches in payment-related code

## Solution
**Immediate Fix (Implemented):**
- Simplified `PaymentStep.tsx` to basic test form
- Removed complex Stripe logic temporarily
- Added basic payment simulation for testing

**Long-term Fix (Required):**
1. **Stripe Integration**: Properly implement Stripe Elements
2. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error boundaries
3. **State Management**: Fix component state issues
4. **Type Safety**: Resolve TypeScript errors in payment components

## Files Affected
- `src/components/PaymentStep.tsx` - Payment step component
- `src/components/PaymentForm.tsx` - Stripe payment form (deleted)
- `src/app/api/create-payment-intent/route.ts` - Payment API endpoint

## Status
**PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - Basic payment step now works, full Stripe integration pending

## Resolution Notes
- Payment step simplified to isolate the issue
- Basic form now renders without errors
- Payment simulation allows testing of the flow
- Full Stripe integration needs to be re-implemented

## Prevention
- Implement error boundaries around payment components
- Test Stripe integration in isolation before integration
- Use proper TypeScript types for all payment-related code
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Test payment flow thoroughly in development environment

## Next Steps
1. Debug the original Stripe integration issues
2. Re-implement full payment functionality
3. Add proper error boundaries and logging
4. Test payment flow end-to-end
5. Verify Apple Pay/Google Pay integration
